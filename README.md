# CACTAS Project
CACTAS(Carotid Artery-Computed Tomographic Angiography Scoring) project is an open-source project that can assist radiologists to diagnose an embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). The goal of our project is to design a program that can characterize qualitative and quantitative morphologic features of calcific plaque. First, for plaque annotation, we designed a web-based tool that can segment plaque in a single click. Next, using machine learning algorithms, we automatically identify calcific plaque in the carotid artery visible in CTA scans and perform image segmentation on them. We then train the algorithm to determine useful features about the plaque, such as its estimated risk to the patient to lead to a stroke, and then create another program to calculate its manual features such as the number, size, and volume. This program would be able to be used as the groundwork to simplify further research tasks in identifying critical features of plaque, such as determining causal relationships between a given feature and estimated risk. The current version (1.0) of this software uses 2D UNet, 2D and 3D Swin UNETR for image segmentation, Random Forest and CNN for risk estimation.

## CACTAS-Tool
CACTAS-Tool is a web-based single-click annotation tool that is 2.89 times faster than manual segmentation. We perform 3D region growing based on a user-selected CT Hounsfield Unit (HU) intensity with a configurable tolerance threshold to include neighboring voxels. Visualization was set to window/level of 130/1500 HU.

## Auto Detection Tool
To automatically detect plaques, we used UNet models - 2D UNet, 2D SwinUNETR, and 3D SwinUNETR.

## Risk Estimation 
We used random forest model to check risk estimation from the auto-detection result.
